# Flight Booking Form

This is a simple and interactive flight booking form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input travel details, submit the form, and receive a personalized confirmation message with their name  attached on another page.

## Features

- Input fields for personal and travel details
- Dynamic confirmation message

- save of the array to local storage which include converting to json.stringify
## How It Works

1. User fills out the flight booking form.
2. On submission, the data is temporarily captured (currently no backend ).
3. A confirmation page appears with a thank-you message and the user name attached.
4. This is then stored to local storage 

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the form and pages.
- **CSS** – for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** – for handling form events and generating the confirmation message and saving to local storage.

## Future Improvements
