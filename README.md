# Flight Booking Form

This is a simple and interactive flight booking form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input travel details, submit the form, and receive a personalized confirmation message on another page.

## Features

- User-friendly flight booking form
- Input fields for personal and travel details
- Dynamic confirmation message 
- Styled with custom CSS (including background image and responsive layout)
- Navigation between form page and confirmation page

## How It Works

1. User fills out the flight booking form.
2. On submission, the data is temporarily captured (currently no backend or local storage).
3. A confirmation page appears with a thank-you message.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the form and pages.
- **CSS** – for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** – for handling form events and generating the confirmation message.

## Future Improvements

- Add form validation and error handling.
- Store data using localStorage or connect to a backend
